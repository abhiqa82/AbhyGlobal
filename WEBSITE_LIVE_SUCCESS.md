## 🔍 About the "DNS check unsuccessful" Message

**Don't worry about this!** It's a false negative from GitHub's automated checker:

1. **Your website IS working** - The screenshot proves it! ✅
2. **HTTPS IS working** - Padlock icon confirms it ✅
3. **DNS IS working** - Website loads correctly ✅
4. **GitHub's automated checker is just slow** - Can take 24-48 hours to update

**The error message is just a display issue - it doesn't affect functionality!**

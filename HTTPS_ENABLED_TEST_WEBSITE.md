# HTTPS Enabled! Test Your Website Now 🎉

## ✅ Excellent News!

Looking at your GitHub Pages settings:

### ✅ What's Working:
1. **TLS Certificate:** ✅ Active (Progress: "3 of 3" complete)
2. **HTTPS:** ✅ Enabled (green checkmark visible)
3. **Certificate Status:** "Certificate Active - The certificate has been activated"

### ⚠️ Still Showing (But Not a Problem):
- "DNS check unsuccessful" - This is a **false negative**
- GitHub's automated DNS checker might be using a slow DNS server
- **But since HTTPS is enabled and certificate is active, DNS IS working!**

## 🎯 The Real Test: Access Your Website

**The best way to verify everything works is to actually visit your website!**

### Step 1: Test Your Website

1. **Open a new browser tab**
2. **Visit:** https://abhyglobal.com
3. **What to expect:**
   - ✅ Website should load normally
   - ✅ You should see a padlock icon (🔒) in the address bar
   - ✅ URL should show `https://abhyglobal.com`

### Step 2: Test www Subdomain

1. **Visit:** https://www.abhyglobal.com
2. **What to expect:**
   - ✅ Should redirect to `https://abhyglobal.com`
   - ✅ Or should load the website directly

## 🔍 Understanding the "DNS check unsuccessful" Message

### Why It Still Shows Error:

1. **GitHub's automated DNS checker is slower:**
   - Uses specific DNS servers that might update slowly
   - Can take 24-48 hours to show success
   - This is just a display issue, not a real problem

2. **Certificate system is more reliable:**
   - Certificate provisioning successfully verified DNS
   - Certificate is active = DNS is working
   - HTTPS enabled = DNS is working

3. **False negative:**
   - The error message is misleading
   - Your DNS is actually configured correctly
   - The certificate activation proves it!
